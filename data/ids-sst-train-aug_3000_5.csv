3174	98da5ed9dac2249879a999b40	 It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists .	3
3175	5ce314c911fe85d1ba018a479	 The film oozes craft .	3
3176	f729123d7c699ea136d30d2af	 Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .	4

3193	b71ca0b0e53724b4d31135b44	 A different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of World War II through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst .	3
3194	d0756c73f461b062c320dfc3b	 It 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .	4
3195	2fd910d3d9ae43cc166096709	 A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo & Stitch had in spades -- charisma .	2
3196	781f351be27c8dbb17860f9ee	 Beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of Grenoble and Geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself .	4

6403	e46ad5a3f9e699aa8ae11696b	 At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .	1
6404	74f6c99ad9cd8f9530e23846a	 A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .	2
6405	dca9b33ac86aab189f4542813	 A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss .	2
6406	739de59ab32c5fc07161eb1c3	 The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .	2
6407	5d0b17c2d4039898ff6f39b3f	 If you recognize Zeus -LRB- the dog from Snatch -RRB- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .	1
6408	dbf5c93d120501e5fbb80aa83	 This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '	0

6411	86b2e8b6d0f7568a71bf33558	 There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .	0

6432	50bd1f94c1b6c46b786c23877	 There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .	1
6433	53c375f5063d0dc5cb9c84f02	 While Howard 's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .	2

6438	69deee1b87ff3bc5f30fe38e4	 Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .	3

6454	19509da4a78518acd839682e0	 We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .	1
